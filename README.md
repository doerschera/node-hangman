# Node Hangman

###Background

This is a simple terminal-based games that uses node modules and packages to create a hangman game.

###Teachnology

- Node
- Modules
- Constructors
- Objects
- Recursive Functions
- Promises
- Inquirer Package

###Process

I started by breaking the game into three modules: word, which randomly gets a word based on the user's chosen difficulty level, letter, which controls the display of blanks and correct guesses in the terminal, and game, which determines if a specific letter is in the chosen word. These modules were then used in the main file in conjunction with inquirer to control game play.
